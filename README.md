</a>

The Barber Shop is designed to enable barbers to offer their customers the convenience of electronically ordering services. Users can easily schedule appointments for desired services by selecting available time slots from a calendar. Prior to selecting a time slot, users are required to enter their payment card information to secure a deposit reservation (see details below).

Users have the flexibility to cancel appointments and choose new ones before the service execution. Timely cancellations do not incur any deposit charges. However, if a user fails to show up for a scheduled appointment, the system automatically charges the deposit amount predetermined by the service provider.

Barbers have control over their availability schedule, service catalog, service durations, and can directly manage and update the calendar by adding or canceling appointments. In case of cancellations, the system automatically notifies affected users, informing them of the canceled appointment and allowing them to select an alternative time slot.

The system also enables service providers to publish their general terms and conditions of business and a pricing list for their services.

Users are notified about their appointments via email and other selected channels of communication, such as Viber. The system sends reminders to users a specified amount of time before their scheduled appointments, as determined by the service provider.

The confirmation notifications sent to users for their reserved appointments are designed to be easily added to their personal calendars, ensuring a seamless integration of the scheduled service into their daily routines.
